An implementation for the graph data structure along with implementation of common graph algorithms. 
An abstract base class Graph is used to model a graph. The derived classes DirectedGraph and UndirectedGraph inherit from class Graph.

The features are-

1. Create a Graph with N vertices.
2. Add an unweighted edge between two vertices u,v.
3. Add a weighted edge between two vertices u,v.
4. Traverse the Graph using BFS or DFS.
5. Check if the Graph is cyclic(Both Undirected and Directed Graph).
6. Get the strongly connected components of a Directed Graph.
7. Get the topological ordering of a directed graph
